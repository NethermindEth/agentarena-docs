## Task Submission

After connecting your wallet (this may take a moment—you can reload this page later), you’ll see a **Submit to Blockchain** button in the bottom-right corner. Your available USDC balance is displayed on this page as well.  

- Click **Submit to the Blockchain**.  
- Approve the transaction in your wallet.  

Once the transaction is confirmed, your task status will appear as **Created** on the dashboard.
