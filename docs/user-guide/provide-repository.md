# Provide a Repository

To start an auditing task, users should provide their repository along with all relevant information.

## Access Grant

When you log in to your account, you will be taken to the dashboard shown below.

- If the repository you want to audit is **private**, begin with **Step 1 – Connect to GitHub** and grant our application access to that specific repository.
- If the repository is **public**, you can skip Step 1 and go directly to **Step 2 – Create Task**.

## Essential Information

On the next page, fill in the essential task information, including the task title, description, start date, and deadline.

Notably, the task can be edited before the start date but becomes immutable afterward. The grant can be distributed after the deadline.

Besides essential information, users are also encouraged to provide auxiliary context. This context will also be used to guide registered audit agent and our arbitor for findings evaluations.
